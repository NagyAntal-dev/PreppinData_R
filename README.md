# My R Journey with Preppin Data

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to my journey of studying R with Preppin Data challenges! This repository serves as a personal learning log and showcases my progress in mastering R programming through the engaging Preppin Data exercises.

## About Me

I'm Antal Nagy, a passionate data enthusiast and aspiring data analyst. I have a keen interest in data manipulation, transformation, and analysis. With the goal of sharpening my R skills, I have embarked on this learning journey with Preppin Data challenges.

## What are Preppin Data Challenges?

Preppin Data Challenges is a fantastic collection of weekly data preparation exercises created by Carl Allchin and Jonathan Allen. These challenges present real-world data scenarios, testing your ability to wrangle, transform, and analyze data effectively. By solving these challenges, I aim to enhance my R programming proficiency and expand my data manipulation toolkit.

## How I'm Using This Repository?

In this repository, you'll find my solutions to various Preppin Data challenges using the R programming language. Each challenge is organized in its own folder, containing the problem statement, data files, and my R code solution. By exploring my solutions, you can gain insights into my thought process and the techniques I employed to solve the challenges.

Feel free to browse through the challenges and witness my growth as an R programmer. Your feedback, suggestions, and contributions are always welcome. Together, we can build a supportive and collaborative community of R learners!
